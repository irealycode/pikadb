# pikadb
open source db,
if this isn't fast enough i'll rewrite it in rust or cpp which should be faster by a lot

how to use:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/irealycode/pikadb.git
```
```
$ cd pikadb
```
>you may have to change pip3 to pip in setup.sh
```
$ sudo bash setup.sh
```
```
$ pikadb
```
now you can use it


- i will share later the version usable in python scripts
